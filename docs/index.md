# Codex Home Docs

This is the documentation index for my global Codex home (`~/.codex`).
It explains how to use prompts and skills across projects.

## Quick usage
- Open the target project repo.
- Read the project `AGENTS.md` and `codex.toml` (if present).
- Use prompts from `prompts/` as needed.
- Use skills from `skills/` when tasks match their descriptions.

## Prompt examples
- Session start: `prompts/lifecycle-session-start.md`
- Feature kickoff: `prompts/lifecycle-feature-kickoff.md`
- Implement feature: `prompts/lifecycle-implement.md`
- Debug loop: `prompts/lifecycle-debug.md`
- Docs update: `prompts/lifecycle-docs.md`
- Release prep: `prompts/lifecycle-release.md`

## Skill examples
- `feature-kickoff`: create a feature spec under `spec/features/`.
- `implement-feature`: implement a feature based on its spec.
- `debug-loop`: reproduce, minimize, test, fix, document.
- `write-tests`: add tests from acceptance criteria.
- `docs-update`: update docs after shipping.
- `release-prep`: run checks and prep release notes.
