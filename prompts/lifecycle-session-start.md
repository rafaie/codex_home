argument-hint: NONE

You are working in this repository.

First, read:
- AGENTS.md (project repo)
- codex.toml (if exists, to override commands)
- docs/index.md (if exists)

Then:
0) Ask clarifying questions before continuing, then follow the matching skill.
1) Summarize the current project state in 5 bullets.
2) List the next 3 highest-impact features (by value/risk) as candidates.
3) Ask me which feature ID to work on next.
