description: Start a work session by summarizing repo state and proposing the top next features.
---

1) Read `AGENTS.md` and `codex.toml` if present.
2) Read `spec/index.md` if it exists, otherwise read `spec/brief.md` if it exists.
3) Check `spec/backlog.md` if it exists.
4) Summarize current project state in 5–10 bullets.
5) Propose the top 3 next features (thin vertical slices), each with a one-sentence rationale.
6) Recommend the next skill to run (usually `qa-intake` or `feature-kickoff`).
